Analysis of State Level Dynamics of Covid-19 Infection

This paper attempts to first fit time series data representing aspects of Corona-19 virus infection and disease for each state (https://covidtracking.com/about-data/faq; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/master/data/states_daily_4pm_et.csv) to an accurate functional form for data from March 3, 2020 to April 13, 2020.  Data science tools are then applied to additional data for each state to determine which of the features contained in the additional state data affect the value of the time-series fit parameters for each state and to what extent those features contribute to the values of the fit parameters.

A paper summarizing the work can be found in the file "State-Level Covid-19 Dynamics.pdf."

Data files used in the analysis can be found in the folder "CovidData."

The four files whose names begin with "Covid_19Normed..." contain the code that was used.

Additional background information is contained in the file "SupportingDocuments."
